#### A capstone project utilizing deep reinforcement learning to predict cryptocurrency markets

This project aims to train and deploy a deep-learned recurrent neural network trained with reinforcement learning with the end-goal of making accurate trades in the cryptocurrency market. The minimum viable product is a RNN that can consistently predict and trade for profit. Once the MVP is implemented, natural language processing on posts originating from [r/CryptoMarkets](reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets) and the Wall Street Journal will be added as features to predict against.

While there are some similar projects being implemented currently, none that I could find (open-source) currently utilize NLP.
Here is a link to one such repo:
[PyTrader](https://github.com/owocki/pytrader)

Naturally, I am not yet proficient in reinforcement learning (using Keras) in trading, so I will need references to help me along the way. Below is one that shows promise.
[The Self Learning Quant](https://hackernoon.com/the-self-learning-quant-d3329fcc9915)

This project represents quite the undertaking and therefore, the capstone will be a proof-of-concept model. I will continue to build upon my product and hopefully implement a cryptomarket analytical tool available for a small subscription.
